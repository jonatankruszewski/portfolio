### My personal Portfolio!

## Hi!

# I created this portfolio to teach to begineers how they can make their own by using just Vanilla JS and Github. Of course, I couldn't resist the temptation and ended up adding also Semantic-UI and some animations from gsap. The form is fully operating too.

# Hope you enjoy it as much as I did in coding it!

# Happy Coding!
